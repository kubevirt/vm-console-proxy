# Build this Dockerfile using the command: make build-container
#
# This multi-stage image approach prevents issues related to cached builder images,
# which may be incompatible due to different architectures, potentially slowing down or breaking the build process.
#
# By utilizing Go cross-compilation, we can build the target Go binary from the host architecture
# and then copy it to the target image with the desired architecture.
